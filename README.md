# Security-Provider-Application

Introduction:

SecProApp stands for Three Step Security Provider application and is providing the user
with three step security that is first step is the normal login based on username and password,
the second step will be the graphical user authentication mechanism and the third step will be
the One time password and there will be an additional security check by the system for the
purpose of log maintenance and the device verification and classify whether the device used is
a personal device or the user is using an another device which is not his.

SecProApp is enabled to log all the details of user activities and report the
suspicious activities to the user on his registered mobile number. Suspicious activities are
defined as those which may cause a threat to the device or the data of the user in any case like
too many wrong attempts of password, too many OTP generation request or expiry of the OTP
in time sense etc. The proposed system would also give a log file reading functionality that will
empower user to know who all logged in the system and what all activities were done on his
computer.

Aim and Scope:

The main aim of the proposed system is to provide the additional layer of security to the
data and the application of the user throughout the cyber space. Data and application security
are a major issue when it comes in todays connected world as they are an easy target to the
attackers. The proposed system can be used in distributed systems and those devices that are
being shared among the people or in institutions like schools and colleges. The scope of the
proposed system is any laptop or computer running on windows 7 or ahead the hardware
requirements are considerably basic and software prerequisites are also considerably basic. The
proposed system has a good ram usage that is not much ram is used for the operation, so the
application is light weight as well

Methodology:

3.1 Functionalities
The Proposed system has mainly the following functionalities which help to provide the
additional security to the data and application. These are the trademarks of the proposed system
and ensure that the interface is user friendly and still provide the security.

3.1.1 Splash Screen
The first opening screen of the application which will be able to load all the required
modules beforehand to make sure the smooth working of the application. The splash screen will
have the logo of the application and a small load time.

3.1.2 Login Window
The login window is the first step of authentication where the authentication will be
done by a username and password. The window will also have option to get registered for the
new user and settings of the proposed system it will also have option like about us. The proposed
system has an account lockdown feature which will lock the account if we enter a wrong
password 5 times. This can be unlocked by the account retrieval module.

3.1.3 Graphical User Authentication
A graphical password is an authentication system that works by having the user select
from images, in a specific order, presented in a graphical user interface (GUI). For this reason,
the graphical-password approach is called graphical user authentication (GUA). The most
common computer authentication method is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords.
This method has been shown to have significant disadvantages. For example, users tend to
choose passwords that can be easily guessed. On the other hand, if a password is difficult to
guess, then it is often difficult to remember. To overcome this problem of low security,
Authentication methods are developed by researchers that use images as password. Graphical
password schemes have been proposed as a possible alternative to text-based schemes, by the
fact that humans can remember pictures better than text; Pictures are generally easier to be
remembered or recognized than text [4].
The next step after the login screen is the Graphical user authentication that is a new
type of authentication system that is not much used by the developers. The GUA in our
proposed system is a recall bases graphical authentication that is the user needs to put the same
sequence images that he used at the time of registration.
The System is using Graphical user authentication as it is immune to brute force and
other text password cracking as the simulation of the image selection needs automation
engineering and the attacker is not that well equipped. GUA also has its upper hand over facial
recognition as the data of facial recognition increases manifold when stored on database.

3.1.4 One Time Password
One-Time password (OTP) is an algorithm that generates a One-Time password using
a shared key and the current time. OTP is now widely used for a two-factor authentication
process to login to websites or other services. The OTP is requested by the server to complete
the login. This OTP is generated locally on the userâ€™s smartphone or any other trusted device.
The server will also run OTP to verify if the entered one-time password matches with the one
generated by the server. The session between the server and the user is then opened and the user
can securely access the system. [2]. The next step or the optional step to GUA is the One-time
password module. The user gets the OTP on his registered mobile number that the user has
provided at the time of registration. One-Time password is the simplest and easy to use module
as the mobile is always with us.

3.1.5 Application Selection
After the authentications steps the user gets to select the application he wants to use, the
application can be selected from the palette of the installed application. The applications
installed are in form of buttons hence user can click the required to get the one he wants to use.
The Application select module is the getaway for the purpose of sandboxing of the application.

3.1.6 Registeration
The user needs to register at the registration window to avail the facilities and features of the
application. The registration is simple step with a few fields like Name, username, password
selection, registered mobile number, the graphical user authentication image series with
sequence and a few security questions for the purpose of account retrieval.

3.1.7 Account Retrival.
What if account may get locked down or the user may forget the password the account
can be retrieved, and the user can enjoy the security of his application again. The process of
account retrieval again comes with proper security of sending an OTP on the registered number
and a confirmation with a mail of the same.

3.1.8 Loggers
The Proposed system comes with a Log File facility that is the proposed system installed
on the system will keep a track of the activities that a user is doing on the system like Login
time, Time for which he was using an application, No. of unsuccessful attempts and also the
account retrieval process if he initiated. The system will also keep a track on the files
downloaded trough the proposed System and will check for any malicious file or any attempt
of security breech.

3.1.9 Settings
The proposed system comes with a setting feature where he can control the working and
alter a few additional like if the system is idle for a specific time then the computer should log
off this time can be selected from setting. The user can also select for which application should
this be applied to. The user can update his information as well and look for the log file. The
setting screen will also give features to the user to manage his SecProApp in later versions like
what type of data will be allowed to enter or exit the SecProApp to enhance the level of security
depending on the users need.
